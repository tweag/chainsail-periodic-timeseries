# Infer periodic timeseries parameters using Chainsail

This repository contains scripts, experiments and other efforts to infer parameters of the periodic timeseries model discussed in [this Stan Discourse thread](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/ideas-for-modelling-a-periodic-timeseries/22038).
The model is highly multimodal and thus is a potential good usecase for Chainsail's Replica Exchange algorithm.
For now, this repository contains
- `probability.py`: a Python module casting the above model into forms consumable by Chainsail, namely:
  - a wrapper around the Stan-defined model using the [Stan wrapper](https://github.com/tweag/chainsail-resources/blob/main/chainsail_helpers/chainsail_helpers/pdf/stan/__init__.py) from the `chainsail-helpers` package
  - a from-scratch implementation of the posterior using pure NumPy / Python, which has the advantage that it provides separate `log_likelihood` and `log_prior` methods that allow for the use of the [likelihood tempering scheme](https://github.com/tweag/chainsail-resources/blob/main/documentation/algorithms/replica_exchange.md#likelihood-tempering). Unfortunately, I'm not sure it is correct, as I got confused with the bounded / unbounded variable and density transforms.
- `chainsail_compatible_model.stan`: a slightly modified version of the original Stan code in the above Discourse post that is compatible with Chainsail (Chainsail requires a flat parameter array, while the original Stan model takes jagged parameters)
- `data.csv`: test data generated with the scripts provided in the [original thread author's gist ](https://gist.github.com/mike-lawrence/716973647a9656133c49e012f4547103)
- `analyze_stan_model_results.py`: a Python script that
  - plots histograms and traces for all (transformed) parameters,
  - a 2D histogram of phase vs. frequency,
  - Replica Exchange schedule and acceptance rates,
  - single-replica stepsizes and acceptance rates.
  
  It expects a Chainsail simulation run directory as its only command line argument. It depends on `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `chainsail-helpers`. All dependencies can are provided via a [Nix](https://nixos.org) shell in `shell.nix`.
- `sampling_results_{rwmc,hmc}_beta{beta_min}_{which replica}.png`: example figures Chainsail run results that use the `httpstan`-backed model definition. `rwmc` refers to a simple Metropolis algorithm for local sampling, and `hmc` to our na√Øve HMC implementation. `beta_min` is the inverse temperature of the "hottest" replica. `which replica` denotes the replica in the Replica Exchange temperature ladder from which the plot was created. If acceptance rates are not good (like around a phase transition), "hotter" replicas more likely show multimodality in sampling, while "cooler" replicas get stuck in modes.
